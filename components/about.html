        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>I am <strong>Sean Luka Girgis</strong>, an Enterprise ML Engineer and Time-Series Forecasting specialist with
            over 20 years of hands-on experience in performance engineering, capacity planning, and large-scale
            application monitoring.</p>

        <p>My career has focused on building high-performance predictive systems for enterprise environments. Most
            recently (2017 – December 2025) I served as a Performance and Capacity Consultant at Citi, where I designed
            and deployed machine-learning-driven forecasting pipelines that analyzed utilization across thousands of
            global servers, automated regional capacity planning, and reduced manual analysis effort by over 85%.</p>

        <p>Key strengths include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Advanced time-series modeling (Prophet, XGBoost, LSTM) and model-competition frameworks</li>
            <li>High-performance Python pipelines (multiprocessing, pandas, scikit-learn) that bypass GIL limitations
                for 10x+ throughput gains</li>
            <li>Enterprise monitoring platforms (CA APM/Wily Introscope, AppDynamics, Dynatrace, BMC TrueSight)</li>
            <li>Data synthesis, ETL automation, interactive dashboards (Streamlit, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)</li>
            <li>Full-stack development background in C/C++, Java, J2EE, Oracle/SQL, and Unix scripting</li>
        </ul>

        <p>My flagship personal project, <strong>HorizonScale AI</strong>, is an open-source predictive capacity
            pipeline capable of forecasting resource utilization for 2,000+ nodes simultaneously using parallel
            Prophet/XGBoost/LSTM models and automated champion/challenger selection.
