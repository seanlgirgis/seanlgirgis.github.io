# Decoupled "Layout" YAML
# This file defines the ORDER and TYPE of blocks, but references content from store.yaml

sections:
  # 0. Global Layout Directives
  - type: stripe_block
    config:
      color: "primary_color"
      height: "8px"
      enabled: true

  # 1. Header (Partially referenced/Mixed)
  - type: header_block
    config:
      content_key: "header_capability_matrix" # Pulls Title/Subtitle from store
      # We can still add local config
      page_break_before: false

  # 2. Contact Info (Compound) - Inline Content (Standard)
  - type: compound_text_block
    config:
      separator: " | "
      font_size: 10
      items:
        - text: "Murphy, TX"
        - text: "214-315-2190"
        - text: "seanlgirgis@gmail.com"

  # 3. Summary (Shaded) - Referenced from Store
  - type: text_block
    config:

      content_key: "summary_profile"

  # 4. Professional Experience Header
  - type: section_title_block
    config:
      content: "PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE (REFERENCED)"
      style: "accented"

  # 5. Experience Item 1 (Compact List used as makeshift item container for test)
  # Ideally, we should use 'list_block' and referencing items. 
  # But for this test, let's use a "Single Block per Job" approach for the test.
  - type: compact_list_block
    config:
      # We reference 'exp_infra_arch' which has left/right/details.
      # Compact list expects 'items' list. 
      # Store has 'exp_infra_arch' as a DICT with 'details'.
      # WE NEED A BLOCK TYPE THAT MATCHES THE DATA STRUCTURE.
      # 'list_block' takes 'items' list.
      # Let's try referencing a LIST of items for a list_block.
      # But store.yaml defined 'exp_infra_arch' as a single job dict.
      #
      # To render a single job, we need a block that renders... a job. 
      # Currently 'list_block' renders a list of jobs.
      # Let's just put explicit items here for now and test the Project Block first.
      title: "Manual Job Entry"
      items:
        - content: "Manual Job A"

  # 7. Page Break
  - type: header_block
    config:
      page_break_before: true
      title: "Page 2"

  # 8. Technical Skills - FULLY REFERENCED
  # Store 'skills_technical' has 'items' which fits 'grid_block' structure
  - type: grid_block
    config:
      content_key: "skills_technical"
      style: "shaded"
